This project is a quiz game about video games developed by Raul Awad and Alejandro Sanchez. The game has a retro arcade style and uses web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Firebase to create a fun and challenging experience.

## Key Features

- **Video Game Questions**: The game features a total of 10 questions related to video games. The questions are provided by an external API and are randomly selected in each round.

- **Timer Counter**: The game includes a timer that penalizes players for taking too long to respond. The faster you answer, the higher your score.

- **Scoring System**: Players earn scores based on their speed and accuracy in answering questions.

- **Firebase Database**: Player results are stored in a Firebase database. This allows tracking scores and displaying a player ranking.

- **Score Chart**: Players can view a chart that shows their game progress over time. This provides a clear visualization of their performance.

- **Player Ranking**: The game displays a ranking of players based on their scores. Players can compete to reach the top spot in the ranking.

## How to Play

2. The timer starts with each question. If you answer correctly, you'll earn scores. If you take too long or answer incorrectly, your score will be penalized.

3. After answering the 10 questions, you'll see your score and can enter your username.
